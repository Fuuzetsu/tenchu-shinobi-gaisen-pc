# Tenchu: Shinobi Gaisen PC

A Rust reimplementation of the gameplay in the PlayStation release
**SLPS-019.01**, using assets from the user's game disc.

The target is faithful mechanics, including gameplay glitches, with a modern
renderer and portable runtime. Gameplay advances at the original nominal rate;
display refresh and graphics settings do not determine game speed. Reproducing
PS1 hardware slowdown is outside the target.

Development starts with Mission 1. The complete goal includes the functionality
of `MAIN.EXE`, all missions, both characters, cinematics, progression and
save/retry. A simple launcher replaces the original main menu.

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for deliverables and acceptance criteria and
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for development conventions.

Game data, captured RAM and disc images must remain outside Git. No BIOS is
required by the intended native runtime. The initial implementation is in
progress; this repository is not yet a playable game.

## Build and inspect a disc

Nix supplies the pinned Rust toolchain and dependencies:

```sh
nix develop
cargo run -p tenchu-pc -- inspect '/path/to/game.cue'
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

`./dev.sh cargo ...` enters the same environment for one command. Use `nix build`
for the native package, `nix run -- inspect /path/to/game.cue` to run it, and
`nix flake check` for tests, formatting and a WASM build of the reusable crates.
ISO files and raw BIN data tracks also work. Disc data is read on demand; it is
never an input to the Nix package or copied into the Nix store.
